Notable roles in his career include the title character of Doogie Howser, M.D., Barney Stinson in How I Met Your Mother, Col. Carl Jenkins in Starship Troopers, Dr. Horrible of the web series Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog, and as a fictionalized version of himself in Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle, Host From Genius Junior and the sequel Harold & Kumar Escape from Guantanamo Bay.\r\n\r\nHarris is openly gay at first. He confirmed this in November 2006 by saying \"...I am happy to dispel any rumors or misconceptions and am quite proud to say that I am a very content gay man living my life to the fullest and feel most fortunate to be working with wonderful people in the business I love. On September 8, 2014, Harris announced on his Twitter page that David Burtka and he were married over the weekend.[2] Harris has twins, Gideon Scott Burtka-Harris and Harper Grace Burtka-Harris.",'One after another, the shots dropped from beyond the midcourt line. Was it three? Four? Could it have been five? Hard to remember. It didn\'t seem significant at the time—just crazy. On a February afternoon last year, Butler sophomore forward Gordon Hayward had gone to Hinkle Fieldhouse for some extra practice. The Bulldogs work out as a team at 6:30 a.m. so they won\'t miss classes, but players often return later for individual sessions. Finished now, Hayward and two teammates were launching half-court shots for fun. Basketball players at all levels do the same thing. "Just messing around," says Hayward. And, hey, you never know.\r\n\r\nA group of prospective students touring the campus entered the building, a basketball shrine built in 1928. At Butler they make sure to show off Hinkle—where Hickory High and Jimmy Chitwood won their state title in Hoosiers (and Milan High and Bobby Plump won their real one)—because, as Butler vice president Tom Weede says, "How many colleges have a movie set on campus?" Hayward threw in one bomb, and the tour kids stopped to watch. Another heave fell through, and a few of the visitors clapped. Yet another went in, and they all sat in the stands. Hayward was already an Indiana treasure. Two years earlier he had scooped up a loose ball and scored at the buzzer to give Brownsburg High a state title, and now he was Butler\'s star, a slender, 6\'8" kid with shaggy hair and soulful gray-blue eyes, straight out of Heartland central casting. Surely the visitors knew whom they were watching. Hayward remembers the afternoon from a distance, hundreds of miles from Hinkle and nearly a year later, and the recollection is more than a little bittersweet. "So, yeah," he says, "I just wish one of those could have been the One."',"Of all the creative people I have come across, Cristóbal Balenciaga was easily the most dedicated to the business of making beautiful things. His work absorbed him totally, and there was no room in his life for anything or anyone else. When the cultural revolution of the 1960s, that disastrous decade, made it impossible (as he saw it) to produce work of the highest quality, he retired and quickly died of a broken heart.\r\n\r\nMaking elegant clothes is one of the most ephemeral but oldest forms of art. The oldest of all, and by its nature even more transient, was body painting, which antedated the art of painting in caves and on stones (itself 40,000 years old) by many centuries. Nothing whatever survives of that, and the clothes worn by our distant ancestors are found only in minute fragments. Indeed, until the sixteenth century complete outfits are the rarest of all artifacts to survive; and until quite modern times museums were lacking in even rudimentary collections of historic clothes. With historians and archivists fighting shy of the subject, one of the most important of human needs and interests was ill recorded. When H. G. Wells began his history of the world (1920s), purporting to put in the subjects conventional historians neglected, he asked the question: “Who did the dressmaking for the Carolingian court?” But he did not provide the answer.\r\n\r\nHe was born on 21 January 1895 in Guetavia, a Basque fishing village. Balenciaga’s father was a sailor and mayor of the village but died young, leaving his wife, Eisa, badly off. There were three children: Augustina, Juan Martin, and Cristóbal, the youngest. Eisa set up as a dressmaker and also taught the village women to sew. Cristóbal, age three and a half, joined the class and showed astonishing skill with a needle. For the next seventy-four years he could, and did, sew superbly, and kept his hand in by doing a piece of sewing (be it only darning) every day of his life. His first original work was a collar set with pearls for his cat.","FAIROUZ IS UNSTUCK IN TIME: one moment, a 1960s starlet in a silk scarf, a Spanish guitar in her hands; the next, a stately elder in a white dress, all regal poise and consoling gaze before an auditorium of fans. Seconds pass and she is Nouhad Haddad, a late-1940s teenager with puppy fat and frizzy schoolgirl hair, before the stage name, the stylist, the international fame.\r\n\r\n“Just search ‘Fairouz morning songs,’” Ahmad told me.1 “There are hundreds of compilations.” This was one of the first I found. Like the images in the slide show, the songs move back and forth through time. The Arabic ensemble — strings, oud, and zither, braiding a single line over the clattering groove of percussion — is replaced now and then by bossa nova guitar or jazzy piano. Throughout it all, the voice is unmistakable. The same tender and maternal tone, alighting softly on consonants; the same clear, high notes and birdlike tumbles down the scale.\r\n\r\nI write your name, my love, on the poplar tree\r\n\r\nAnd you write my name, my love, in the sand of the street\r\n\r\nMy God, her voice is like honey, writes one commenter. This is an unusually civil corner of YouTube. Many just stop to say good morning, in the ornate way Arabic allows: morning of hope, morning of roses, morning of love. Others reminisce, and in this the Syrians outnumber any other nationality, even those from the diva’s native Lebanon. That morning sun, that smell of Damascene jasmine, and Fairouz filling every house. God, may those days return. One comment recurs like a mantra, repeated almost word for word under every compilation video like this: There is nothing sweeter than starting the day with a cup of coffee and the voice of Fairouz."];
